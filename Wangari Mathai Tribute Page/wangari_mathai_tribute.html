			<h2 class="text-center">Here's a time line of Prof. Wangari Maathai's life:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><span class="year">1940</span>
				 -Wangari Mathai is born at Ihithe, Nyeri, Kenya.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1948</span>
				 -She joined Ihithe Primary School.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1951</span>
				 -Moved to St. Cecilia's Intermediate Primary School, a boarding school at the Mathari Catholic Mission in Nyeri where she became fluent in English and converted to Catholicism..</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1956</span>
				 -She was rated first in her class, and was granted admission to the only Catholic high school for girls in Kenya, Loreto High School in Limuru..</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1960</span>
				 -She received a scholarship to study at Mount St. Scholastica College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, Kansas, where she majored in biology, with minors in chemistry and German</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1964</span>
				 -After receiving her bachelor of science degree she studied at the University of Pittsburgh for a master's degree in biology. Her graduate studies there were funded by the Africa-America Institute and during her time in Pittsburgh, she first experienced environmental restoration, when local environmentalists pushed to rid the city of air pollution.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1966</span>
				 -Received her M.Sc in biological sciences and was appointed to a position as research assistant to a professor of zoology at University College of Nairobi.When she arrived at the university to start her new job, she was informed that it had been given to someone else. Maathai believed this was because of gender and tribal bias.<br>
				 After a two-month job search, Professor Reinhold Hofmann, from the University of Giessen in Germany, offered her a job as a research assistant in the microanatomy section of the newly established Department of Veterinary Anatomy in the School of Veterinary Medicine at University College of Nairobi.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1967</span>
				 -At the urging of Professor Hofmann, she traveled to the University of Giessen in Germany in pursuit of a doctorate. She studied both at Giessen and the University of Munich.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1969</span>
				 -She returned to Nairobi to continue studies at the University College of Nairobi as an assistant lecturer. In May, she and Mwangi Mathai married.Later that year, she became pregnant with her first child, Waweru.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1971</span>
				 -Became the first Eastern African woman to receive a PhD, her doctorate in veterinary anatomy,from the University College of Nairobi. Her daughter, Wanjira, was born.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1975-1977</span>
				 -Continued to teach at Nairobi, becoming a senior lecturer in anatomy, chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy and associate professor. She was the first woman in Nairobi appointed to any of these positions.During this time, she campaigned for equal benefits for the women working on the staff of the university, going so far as trying to turn the academic staff association of the university into a union, in order to negotiate for benefits. The courts denied this bid, but many of her demands for equal benefits were later met.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1974</span>
				 -Following the establishment of the Environment Liaison Centre. Maathai was asked to be a member of the local board, eventually becoming board chair. The Environment Liaison Centre worked to promote the participation of non-governmental organizations in the work of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Maathai also joined the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK). Through her work at these various volunteer associations, it became evident to Maathai that the root of most of Kenya's problems was environmental degradation. Had her third child, Muta.<br>
				 Founded  Envirocare Ltd, a business that involved the planting of trees to conserve the environment, involving ordinary people in the process. This led to the planting of her first tree nursery, collocated with a government tree nursery in Karura Forest. Envirocare ran into multiple problems, primarily dealing with funding. 
				 </li>
				 <li><span class="year">1976</span>
				 -Through conversations concerning Envirocare and her work at the Environment Liaison Centre, UNEP made it possible to send Maathai to the first UN conference on human settlements, known as Habitat I.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1977</span>
				 -Marking World Environment Day, the NCWK marched in a procession from Kenyatta International Conference Centre in downtown Nairobi to Kamukunji Park on the outskirts of the city where they planted seven trees in honor of historical community leaders. This was the first "Green Belt" which was first known as the "Save the Land Harambee" and then became the Green Belt Movement. Maathai encouraged the women of Kenya to plant tree nurseries throughout the country, searching nearby forests for seeds to grow trees native to the area. She agreed to pay the women a small stipend for each seedling which was later planted elsewhere.<br>
				 Separated with husband. Mwangi was said to have believed Wangari was "too strong-minded for a woman" and that he was "unable to control her".
				 Shortly after the divorce, her former husband sent a letter via his lawyer demanding that Maathai drop his surname. She chose to add an extra "a" instead</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1983</span>
				 -In the course of her work through the NCWK, she was approached by Wilhelm Elsrud, executive director of the Norwegian Forestry Society. He wished to partner with the Green Belt Movement and offered her the position of coordinator. Employed again, Maathai poured her efforts into the Green Belt Movement. Along with the partnership for the Norwegian Forestry Society, the movement had also received "seed money" from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Women. These funds allowed for the expansion of the movement, for hiring additional employees to oversee the operations, and for continuing to pay a small stipend to the women who planted seedlings throughout the country. It allowed her to refine the operations of the movement, paying a small stipend to the women's husbands and sons who were literate and able to keep accurate records of seedlings planted.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1986</span>
				 -With funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya over the next three years to learn how to set up similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1987</span>
				 -The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai's being honoured with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women's issues, not the environment. Maathai stepped down as chairman of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organization</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1989</span>
				 -Maathai learned of a plan to construct the 60-story Kenya Times Media Trust Complex in Uhuru Park, and started to protest against it. She wrote to Sir John Johnson, the British high commissioner in Nairobi, urging him to intervene with Robert Maxwell, a major shareholder in the project, equating the construction of a tower in Uhuru Park to such construction in Hyde Park or Central Park and maintaining that it could not be tolerated.The government of Kenya refused to respond to her inquiries and protests.<br>
  				 Despite Maathai's protests, as well as popular protest growing throughout the city, ground was broken at Uhuru Park for construction of the complex on  Maathai sought an injunction in the Kenya High Court to halt construction, but the case was thrown out.She was forced by the government to vacate her office, and the Green Belt Movement was moved into her home. The government then audited the Green Belt Movement in an apparent attempt to shut it down.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1990</span>
				 -Her protests, the government's response – and the media coverage it garnered – led foreign investors to cancel the project.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1998</span>
				 -Maathai learned of a government plan to privatize large areas of public land in the Karura Forest, just outside Nairobi, and give it to political supporters. Maathai protested this through letters to the government and the press. She went with the Green Belt Movement to Karura Forest, planting trees and protesting the destruction of the forest.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">1999</span>
				 -A group of protesters including Maathai, six opposition MPs, journalists, international observers, and Green Belt members and supporters returned to the forest to plant a tree in protest. The entry to the forest was guarded by a large group of men. When she tried to plant a tree in an area that had been designated to be cleared for a golf course, the group was attacked. Many of the protesters were injured, including Maathai, four MPs, some of the journalists, and German environmentalists. When she reported the attack to the police, they refused to return with her to the forest to arrest her attackers. However, the attack had been filmed by Maathai's supporters, and the event provoked international outrage.Student protests broke out throughout Nairobi, and some of these groups were violently broken up by the police. Protests continued until  when the president announced that he was banning all allocation of public land.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">2001</span>
				 -The government again planned to take public forest land and give it to its supporters. While protesting this and collecting petition signatures on 7 March 2001, in Wang'uru village near Mount Kenya, Maathai was again arrested. The following day, following international and popular protest at her arrest, she was released without being charged.</li>
				 <li><span class="year">2002</span>
				 -Maathai returned to teaching as the Dorothy McCluskey Visiting Fellow for Conservation at the Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. She remained there until June 2002, teaching a course on sustainable development focused on the work of the Green Belt Movement.Upon her return to Kenya, Maathai again campaigned for parliament in the 2002 elections, this time as a candidate of the National Rainbow Coalition, the umbrella organization which finally united the opposition. On 27 December 2002, the Rainbow Coalition defeated the ruling party Kenya African National Union, and in Tetu Constituency Maathai won with an overwhelming 98% of the vote.</li>
